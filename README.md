# ChimeHack2
We want to empower victims of sexual harassment/assault to report/share their experiences anonymously through geotagged posts and pictures and contribute to a map visualization of sexual harassment available for all users. Through these anonymous geo-tagged posts, users can not only help other users navigate their cities safely but also provide data for NPOs and police enforcement to take future meaningful action. Besides a social network between users, we will visualize the data real-time and ideally create an API (future feature) to serve as tools for NPOs/police enforcement/etc  to use.
