# Campus Aware

> Our mission is to empower victims of sexual harassment or sexual assault to actively report their experiences anonymously through geotagged posts and pictures and contribute to a map visualization of sexual harassment available for all users. 

Through these anonymous geo-tagged posts, users can not only help other users navigate their cities safely but also provide data for NPOs and police enforcement to take future meaningful action. Besides a social network between users, we will visualize the data real-time and ideally create an API (future feature) to serve as tools for NPOs/police enforcement/etc  to use.




# How it works
> We took a 4 prong approach to this problem: community-driven, anonymous space to report injustice, real time data, and accountability.

#### Community-Driven
Each user is affiliated with their campus because we believe that students are motivated by making their own campus better.

#### Anonymous
Users can report an incident to the app as a bystander or victim anonymously through geotagged posts that we use to generate a map visualization for users.

#### Real-time Data
As reports populate our map, we provide real time data through a REST API for University administration, non-profits, police, student groups and organizations and users to use to for data analysis, data visualizations or campus sexual assault reports.

#### Accountability
By providing our data publicly, we believe that we are holding Universities more accountable for their current efforts on sexual harassment/violence on their campus.

# Screenshots

#### Main Report Visibility: 
> a user enters a zipcode or we collect geodata of te user so that she/he can view reports within their community. They can simply click an individual pin on Goolge Maps to navigate to details of the report.

#### Reporting Page: 
> our belief is that reporting should be simple, intuitive and available. We collect minimum required data from a report, keeping the reporter's privacy.
